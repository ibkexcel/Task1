    <div>4 out of 5 stars</div>
    <p>From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete(Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover
        (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of friendship sounds
       familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he is doggone good at it.
    </p>
     <div>This movie has everything you could ask for:</div>
     <ul>
        <li>Basketball</li>
        <li>A dog</li>
        <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
     </ul>
     <p>While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball
        Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of it's 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears.
        If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.</p>
